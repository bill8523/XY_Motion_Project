# XY_Motion_Project

this code is my capston design project in university

originally, this code was using for cortex-M4(stm32f407) Board.
but, I've changed my code because I can't use original code because of hardware.

so, I convert original code to simulate code.
finally, It works without any hardware.

I check up my code hardly.
but, code is still mass. I have to clean up my code someday.
